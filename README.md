# Rename
Rename photos and screenshots to `YYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext` format.

## Usage

pip-installing will install two commands:
- `rename_picture` will use the picture data to create the new name, 
use this at the end of the year on camera roll.
- `rename_screenshot` renames MacOS screenshots on the desktop, using their existing name.
